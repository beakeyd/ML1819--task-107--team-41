# Todo 
Classification based on Single feature set + relevant plots
    - Numerical Classification
    - Text Classification
    - goal to figure out the most representative features

Classification based on multiple representative feature sets + relevant plots
    - Can you mix numerical and text classification? I don't think so on a single model
    - Multiple classification algorithms to compare accuracy.
    - goal is to achieve greatest prediction accuracy + compare different algorithms
